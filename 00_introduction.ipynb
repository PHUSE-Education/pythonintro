    "Python is an open-source programming language that was created and first released in 1991 by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interpreted language, it does not require a separate compilation step (turning source code into machine code)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supported on pretty much every platform, as well as through the use of cloud computing platforms loading and executing Jupyter Notebooks"

    "* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "* [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)\n",

    "* [AWS Sagemaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook servers are attractive for many reasons; \n",
    "* they don't require you installing anything on your machine which you may not want to do (or not be allowed to)  \n",
    "* they can be backed with cloud storage so can be accessed from anywhere; in the example of Colab, your notebooks can be saved to your google drive\n",
    "* large persistent datasets can be stored centrally (important for machine learning projects where you spend large resources training/validating)\n",
    "* access to specialised hardware without the burden of owning and managing them (such as GPU Arrays)\n",
    "* easy to share\n",
